# Scala Demonstrations

This is a collection of demonstration classes and programs for Scala. The
main intent for this is for me to experiment with and learn the Scala
language. As such, this will re-implement various constructs.

In order to build the projects, you need to fetch the jar dependencies. This
can be done by running:

	make deps
